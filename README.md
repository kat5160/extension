# WaveNet for Chrome
A wrapper for Google Cloudâ€™s text-to-speech services that transforms highlighted text into high-quality natural sounding audio.

## How to use
* [Download the chrome extension in the Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wavenet-for-chrome/iefankigbnlnlaolflbcopliocibkffc).
* [Generate an API Key using Google Cloud's Console](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n8xlVNWEZ0).
* Paste the API Key in the extension's popup menu.
* Right click on highlighted text and click "Read this by WaveNet for Chrome".

Note: Although WaveNet for Chrome is a free extension and Google Cloud's text-to-speech services offer the first 1 million characters free of charge, the regular pricing is [$16.00USD per 1 million characters](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/pricing).
